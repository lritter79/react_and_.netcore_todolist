# react-crash-2021
Task tracking application from the React crash course

Based on Brad Traversy's react.js tutorial, modified by me.

The C# backend logic includes EF Core, LINQ, ASP.NET Core API, and Automapper.
The app uses JWT for authentication.
The front end uses bootstrap, css, and reactstrap.
I wrote some custom hooks for the react side, including UseShowToast and UseToken.
