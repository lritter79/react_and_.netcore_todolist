# react-crash-2021
Task tracking application from the React crash course

Based on Brad Traversy's react.js tutorial, modified by me.
Now included a backend in ASP.NET Core.

The database logic includes EF Core, LINQ, and Automapper.
The app uses JWT for authentication.
The front end uses bootstrap and react strap
